\section*{Preface}

The work of this thesis has been performed at the Department of Computer and
Information Science (IDI) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(NTNU), and in collaboration with SINTEF Technology and Society during the
spring semester of 2014. \\

During the work of this thesis, I have been supervised by Sobah Abbas Pettersen
and co-supervised by researcher Andreas Landmark (SINTEF), research manager
Andreas Seim (SINTEF), and researcher Rimmert van der Kooij (SINTEF), who have
all been a great help throughout the process, providing valuable input and
guidance.

I would also like to thank fellow students Magnus Bae and Bj√∏rn Thomas Vee for
feedback and help when needed.\\

I have also been part of the student organization Revolve NTNU this semester,
which is a group of students building a prototype formula student race car for
participating in the international Formula Student competitions. I would like
thank my fellow team members for participating in some of the best times I have
experienced.

A final thank you to my supervisors for understanding that participating in
Revolve NTNU has made time difficult to balance.
