\section{Introduction}
The intention of this document is to record the requirements discovered for 
the system being developed. This document is an important part of the basis 
for the design and development of the system under discussion (SuD).

The SuD is a prototype driver information system that is being developed in
cooperation with Revolve NTNU. The purpose of the system is to replace the
traditional dashboard HDD with a HUD solution mounted or carried inside the 
helmet of a race car driver. This system is being designed to interact with 
the cars on-board sensor network, but also to be general enough that it can be
used with other vehicles given hardware support.

This document will through use cases, system sequence diagrams and a domain 
model give a logical and conceptual description of the SuD and its interaction
with other systems. All descriptions are black-box descriptions of the system
and sub-systems.

\subsection{Scope}
This document does not describe details of external systems (like sensor
network or CAN-bus, sensors, mechanical components). The purpose of this
document is to describe the system that is to be developed and the requirements
that the system need to meet. 


\subsection{Definitions and abbreviations}
