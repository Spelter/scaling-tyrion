pages = {149-161},
abstract = {This unclassified presentation discusses in detail the tactical applications of current technology helmet mounted display (HMD) systems in fighter aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16. Emphasis will be on potential uses of the system from an operator's viewpoint, with discussions involving the types of information desired by the pilot, basic human factors requirements, and the interfaces of an HMD into other on-board systems. The uses of a stroke symbology system are exclusively discussed because it is sensor-independent and has potential applications in most tactical aircraft. This report is divided into three major operational sections: air-to-air, air-to-ground, and defense suppression. Each operational area is briefly outlined, and a generic profile of current capabilities is developed. The increased capabilities provided by an HMD system are discussed, as well as the requirements for an optimum system that interfaces with a digital intra/inter-flight data link and an on-board digital threat warning system. Based upon the criteria developed in the operational discussions, this report lists a compendium of basic requirements for designers of operational HMD systems and outlines the merits and liabilities of each requirement.},
