\begin{itemize}
	\item Important characteristics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stakeholders 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Defined relevant stakeholders in a hierarchy for more easy 
			aggregation (stakeholder awareness).
			\item Defined requirements of the stakeholders (what information 
			do they need)
			\item Clearly defined responsibility area per level in hierarchy (
			example in data sets)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Data sets
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Information stored accordingly to stakeholders
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In this case as example, stations defined per 
				responsibility area
				\item Other info is connected to stakeholders through
				stations, for clarification of connected to:
				\item Other info is connected to stakeholders through stations, for clarification of connected to
				see following 3 points:
				\item For crossings between trains, compares on equal 
				station at the same time
				\item Density is between given stations
				\item This means stations are stored per area, and other 
				info is fetched according to this.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Generalize data storage
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Easier to remove or add more data to a data set
				\item When having generalized data storage and generalized 
				aggregation, it means it is much easier to add other type of data sets
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Aggregation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generalize methods for reuse throughout the hierarchy levels and
			through different types of information
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This could mean generating equal return data structure regardless of
				stakeholder hierarchy level and type of data
				\item Results in a much more general information display
				\item Aggregate over data on the step between data storage and presentation
			\end{itemize}
			\item Aggregate through data from different sources
			\item When the data is relative simple (read for instance count per station), a simple aggregation is averaging the data through different stakeholder hierarchy
			level.
			\item Data presentation view based on current selected stakeholder 
			which in turns determines what should be aggregated and returned to be
			presented
		\end{itemize}
		\item Data retrieval optimization
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Minimize data traffic
			\item Efficient queries to minimize execution time
			\item Generality in storage and queries for scalability both  
			in size and data types needed
			\item External vs local storage?
			\item All in one or independent data storage per information 
			type?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Navigation through time and space
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Have a selectable time intersection for limiting data view
			\item "Zoom" the data in space based on the responsibility area/needs of the stakeholders, in this case, fit the visible section of the map to the relevant stations
		\end{itemize}

%\section{Prototype} % (fold)
%\label{sec:prototype}
%In this section we will describe how the developed prototype implemented the
%problem of the research question.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item What are important characteristics for a stakeholder aware method to 
%	aggregate over a rich set of data?
%\end{itemize}
%
%When a important part of the system is to be aware of stakeholders and their
%requirements and needs, we found it important to have a easy way of selecting 
%different stakeholders. By having this selection,  We presented this in \Ref{sub:front_end_aggregation}.
