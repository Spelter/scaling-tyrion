\section{Stakeholders and aggregation} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion_stakeholders_and_aggregation}
It is important to define the needs and requirements of the stakeholders early 
in the process, in order to design a system that gives the right scope. 
By the aid of workshops we defined the requirements, as it is part of the 
research method (see \Ref{sec:workshops}). We can define the stakeholders in a 
hierarchy based on their organization structure and responsibility areas, 
which helps us defining the requirements so the requirements help us define 
the structure for the information.

There is a good synergy between the requirements and the system, when the 
system is designed with the requirements in mind. The synergy between the
requirements and the requirements can have both advantages and disadvantages. 
On one side the system has a great possibility to satisfy the requirements and 
needs of the stakeholders, since the system is tightly connected to the 
requirements. On the other side, the system can be inflexible to large 
changes, if the requirements change late in the project.  In the workshops, we 
defined that the stakeholders must have the ability to view different kinds of 
information; the system must take these needs into consideration. A system 
aware of the stakeholders needs might end up being more complex, and has to 
process a larger amount of data in order to give the system the required 
functionality. Processing larger amounts of data leads to a more complex 
system. The system can be more dynamic, although complex, by reusing parts of 
the data processing for different information types, when designed with the 
needs as well as the requirements in mind. In order to meet the requirements 
of the stakeholders needs we need to aggregate the data. There are several 
ways to aggregate the groups of data according to the given criteria. One can 
argue which aggregation method fits the stakeholders' requirements best, 
taking into account for example the following alternatives: average, minimum, 
maximum, median, and count. Deciding the aggregation method, we have to 
consider how each information type is structured, but also how this structure 
fits in with the stakeholders' hierarchy. With the aid of the workshops, it 
was decided to average the data as the aggregation method, based on how the 
data is connected to the stakeholders with their hierarchy.



As important as the data processing is, one must not forget the presentation of
the data. By using the hierarchy based list of areas of responsibility for the
stakeholders, one has the opportunity to fit the visual display to the current
stakeholder. In one way, to fit the display to the stakeholder can prove 
useful since the presentation only displays information relevant for the 
current stakeholder, in another way to let the user decide what level of 
visualization the visual display shall present can be more since the display 
then have the opportunity to present more overall information. By having the 
opportunity to jump
back and forth within the hierarchy of stakeholders, we decided to fit the 
visual presentation of data to the current stakeholder. Since the display was 
adapted to the user, the display enabled the user to receive more relevant 
information on the current stakeholder.

\section{Data storage and data queries} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion_data_storage_and_data_queries}
%By having several types of information which have different structure and
%originating from different sources, raises the question of how the data storage
%shall be structured. One way to structure the data storage, is to merge all the
%data sets into one large database. When having one large, merged 
%database, one experiences little maintainability, which is the degree where a
%product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers\cite[p. 195]{Bass:2012:SAP:2392670}.
%By storing the data sets in one large database, one avoids duplicating data in
%the databases.

%Another way to structure the data storage is to store the data sets in
%independent storages with a loose coupling between the structures. Since most 
%changes to a system happens after initial release, as described by Bass, 
%Clements, and Kazman \cite[pp. 117-124]{Bass:2012:SAP:2392670},
%means that when the data sets are designed with built-in flexibility, 
%exercising the built-inn flexibility is usually cheaper than to hand-
%code a specific change in hindsight. By having these loosely linked data sets,
%one have achieved a modifiable data storage. This thesis demonstrated this
%principal by having the stations stored in a hierarchy data set based one the 
%stakeholder hierarchy, and the other data sets connected to the stations.\\

			\item The system will be more efficient in the processing of the 
			data, when limiting the quires.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Front end vs back end data processing for system efficiency and
		limiting data traffic
		\item Should the data be processed in the front-end or the back-end 
		of the system?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The data should be aggregated in the back-end of the system, 
			since it is more efficient.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Quicker calls to the database from the back-end.
				\item Less data traffic during transfer of.
				\item Usually quick hardware on server side, while it have a 
				great span in the front-end.
