\section{Stakeholders and aggregation} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion_stakeholders_and_aggregation}
Since the stakeholders, with their requirements and needs, are an important of
systems similar to the one presented in this thesis, we found the importance to
early define the requirements and needs. As part of the research method, we
defined the requirements by the help of workshops, see \Ref{sec:workshops}. 

By having a system which have a strong connection to the requirements, the 
system easily ends up with the requirements affecting every part of the 
system. The strong connection with the requirements can have both advantages 
and disadvantages. On one side the system are tightly connected to the
stakeholder, and have great possibility to satisfy the requirements and needs
of the stakeholders. On the other side, the strong connection means that if 
there are large changes to the requirements late in the project, the system 
can be very little flexible to these changes. As the workshops also defined 
that the stakeholders have the need for the ability to view different kind of 
information, the system must take these needs into consideration also. Since 
the system now has more information to process, one could argue that the 
amount of information to process affects how the system is aware of the 
requirements since the amount of information increases the complexity of the 
system. However, since the need for different type of information was defined 
along side the requirements, by having internal variables for the information 
type in the same manner as the stakeholders; the system is to use these needs 
for the benefit of the stakeholder. \\

Since the requirements states the stakeholders are defined in a hierarchy with
larger and larger responsibility area upwards in the hierarchy, we implemented
aggregation as a way to processes the data according to the stakeholders. When
aggregating, there are several different ways to group together the different
values according to a given criteria. Between the different aggregation method,
such as average, minimum and maximum, median, and count, one could argue that 
there is possible to argue which methods fits the stakeholders the best. When 
deciding for the aggregation method, not only does one have to consider how 
each information type is structured, but also how this structure fits against 
the stakeholder hierarchy. Since the data is connected to the stakeholders by 
the responsibility areas, the decision was made with the help of the workshops 
that the aggregation method that fitted best with the requirements was to 
average through the data.

As important as the data processing is, one must not forget the presentation of
the data. By using the hierarchy based list of areas of responsibility for the
stakeholders, one has the opportunity to fit the visual display to the current
stakeholder. In one way, to fit the display to the stakeholder can prove 
useful since the presentation only displays information relevant for the 
current stakeholder, in another way to let the user decide what level of 
visualization the visual display shall present can be more since the display 
then have the opportunity to present more overall information. By having the 
opportunity to jump
back and forth within the hierarchy of stakeholders, we decided to fit the 
visual presentation of data to the current stakeholder. Since the display was 
adapted to the user, the display enabled the user to receive more relevant 
information on the current stakeholder.

\section{Data storage and data queries} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion_data_storage_and_data_queries}
By having several types of information which have different structure and
originating from different sources, raises the question of how the data storage
shall be structured. One way to structure the data storage, is to merge all the
data sets into one large database. When having one large, merged 
database, one experiences little maintainability, which is the degree where a
product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers\cite[p. 195]{Bass:2012:SAP:2392670}.
By storing the data sets in one large database, one avoids duplicating data in
the databases.

Another way to structure the data storage is to store the data sets in
independent storages with a loose coupling between the structures. Since most 
changes to a system happens after initial release, as described by Bass, 
Clements, and Kazman \cite[pp. 117-124]{Bass:2012:SAP:2392670},
means that when the data sets are designed with built-in flexibility, 
exercising the built-inn flexibility is usually cheaper than to hand-
code a specific change in hindsight. By having these loosely linked data sets,
one have achieved a modifiable data storage. This thesis demonstrated this
principal by having the stations stored in a hierarchy data set based one the 
stakeholder hierarchy, and the other data sets connected to the stations.\\
