%Piloting map service for navigating in punctuality analysis for trains

A train network is a complex system. Almost every running train have the 
possibility to affect almost every other train running in the system.  When you look at a busy area, such as a major city and it's closest
area, a great deal of material can be on the move at any given time on a
limited rail network. This leads to limited time slots for each train and every
problem can lead to major problems, not just for the train experiencing the
problem, but can spread to other trains. \\

To minimize delays it may be necessary to improve both infrastructure and/or
time table on railway routes or parts of routes. However, to understand what
needs to be improved and optionally where, you need a good tool to analyze the
rail network capacity\cite{landex2009gis}, and if necessary, visualize
each individual train\cite{zugmonitor} in the rail network to follow delays to the source.
