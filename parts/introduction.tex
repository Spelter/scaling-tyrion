\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

This thesis will discuss analysis of train delays and visualization of these
delays. It will involve making a prototype map visualization of delays based on
train routes in Norway. This prototype will involve features such as being able
to play through a certain time period, which will be selectable, both backwards
and forwards. It will also make it possible to study each train delay to make
it possible to track the delays through the Norwegian rail network, and
hopefully make it possible to spot why a train is delayed.

As will be discussed in \vref{chapter:background}, some plotting examples
exists already, however none of them covers what this thesis will research.
