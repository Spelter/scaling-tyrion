This thesis discusses the  analysis of train delays and the visualization of 
these delays. It involves making a prototype map visualization of delays 
based on train routes in Norway. This prototype involves features such as 
the ability to scroll through a certain time period (which will be selectable), 
both backwards and forwards. This prototype also make it possible to study each train 
delay to make it possible to track the delays through the Norwegian rail 
network, and make it possible to spot why a train is delayed.

We discuss this in Chapter \Vref{chapter:background}, some plotting 
examples exists already, however none of them covers what this thesis will 
research.

\section{Research Question and Goals} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_research_question}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{What are important characteristics for a stakeholder aware method to 
	aggregate over a rich set of data?}
\end{itemize}

Goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop a map based prototype for train analysis.
\end{itemize}

Sub goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Display dashboard with relevant information accordingly to current zoom level.
	\item Aggregate through statistical data according to current level.
	\item Limit the data visualization within selectable time scales.
	\item Select different type of statistical data to display.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Display information for traffic density.
		\item Display information for Speed restrictions.
		\item Display information for train crossings.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders} % (fold)  
\label{sec:intro_stakeholders}  
For any given project, there exists
several stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals and/or organizations who have a interest or are involved directly in the
project, whether it be involvement in the execution of the project, or have interest which overlap
with the results of the project. Because each stakeholder either represents different end user 
types or people with a general interest in the project, in the end there will be many needs to 
take into consideration. Since this will eventually turn into a stakeholder aware system, with 
focus on stakeholders representing end users, there will end up presenting a lot of data.

\section{Aggregation} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_aggregation}
When taking into consideration that many different stakeholders demands different levels of
information presented, the presentation quickly have the possibility to become very messy and
difficult to understand. One solution to this, is to aggregate the data according to some kind of
sorting of the stakeholders. When one aggregates data, groups of observations are replaces with
summary statistics based on those observations\cite{ wiki:Aggregation}.

\section{Data Sets} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_data_sets}
One of the problems with a task such as this, is that the data sets can grow quite large. Depending
on what one might need, these large data sets can be quite problematic to access in a quick and
reliable way. This problem grows in complexity quickly when one is supposed to take into
consideration several sets of data containing different type of information.
