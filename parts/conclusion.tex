To have a system that are capable of awareness of stakeholder and their needs
to aggregate over a rich set of data, it is important to both have a clearly
defined stakeholders with their requirements and needs, datasets which are 
adapted to the stakeholders, and aggregation methods which fit the 
stakeholders needs and the datasets. 

We have created a prototype to help define important characteristics for a
system that are aware of the stakeholder and their needs when processing data,
by the use of the Design Science Research Process. To properly define the 
stakeholders, their needs, and their areas of responsibility in a hierarchy is 
crucial, as everything is based on the stakeholders and their needs and 
requirements. The system is able to fetch data according to the needs of the 
current stakeholder and processes the data according to their step in the
hierarchy, by being able to navigate through the hierarchy. \\

In order to have the ability to navigate the hierarchy and process the data 
accordingly, the areas of responsibility should be stored in the hierarchy for 
enabling the system to find the compatible data with the areas. The different
datasets should be stored in a structure that enables a dynamic link to the
hierarchy. We proposed a semi-distributed databases, where the hierarchy is
stored in a database and the other datasets connected to the stakeholder
through the hierarchy database. The database structure proposed does demand
that the datasets are processed to a similar structure, and merged to a
consistent definition of data fields. 

Use of the hierarchy based areas of responsibility is important, to aggregate 
the datasets according the stakeholders and their requirements. The 
aggregation method should be specified in the requirements for each 
information type, as each data set can be different and/or the stakeholders 
have a different need for that information.

The system should be able to use the visual presentation of the data to limit
the visualization to the current stakeholder, by use of the area of
responsibility of the current stakeholder.\\


When defined within the domain, the stakeholders needs to be organized on a 
structure which enables awareness from the system. During the work of this 
thesis, we present a structure where the stakeholders have been placed in a 
hierarchy according to their areas of responsibility. By organizing a 
hierarchy of the stakeholder, we are able to process the data and limit the 
presentation according to the active stakeholder.
