\section*{Summary}

In this report we will present a proposal for a computerized driver information
system and its software architecture. The system is being developed in
collaboration with Revolve NTNU, which is a team of volunteering students
participating in the Formula Student series of competitions with their
self-designed and built car. 

The idea behind the system is to create an
enabling driver information system for use in motorsport -- an area where
driver information systems have not developed much, despite great developments
in other areas. 

We propose a type of driver information system new to motorsport, a head-up
display solution utilizing a wearable display receiving telemetry data through
a wireless link from the vehicles on-board sensor network. 

To enable this system the report describes a software architecture designed to
provide a system that has high modifiability traits, using concurrent
reconfigurable transformation pipelines and a software definable network
system for communication with sensor networks. 

Although no verification has been performed on the architecture, we propose
metrics that can be used to verify the architectures ability to meet the goals
and requirements specified.
